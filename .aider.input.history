+Code the following app
+```
+A quiz that lets someone find out what kind of “Love Hotel” energy they have (inspired by Bravo’s latest dating reality show vibes) by answering 5 multiple choice questions, and then allows them to share their result.
+
+Create 4 result tiers based on their score/personality type:
+
+Tier 1 – “Guarded Guest” (cautious, slow to open up)
+
+Tier 2 – “Vacation Flirt” (fun, flirty, here for a good time)
+
+Tier 3 – “Open-Hearted Romantic” (genuinely looking for connection)
+
+Tier 4 – “Reality TV Heartbreaker” (main-character energy, steals every scene)
+
+Generate a unique cute cartoon vector illustration for each result tier featuring a glam resort-style character checking into a luxury “love hotel” setting (no real-person likenesses):
+
+Guarded Guest – chic but reserved, suitcase, sunglasses
+
+Vacation Flirt – colorful outfit, cocktail, playful pose
+
+Open-Hearted Romantic – holding a flower or love letter, soft expression
+
+Reality TV Heartbreaker – full glam, camera in the background, confident pose
+
+Display the corresponding image, tier name, and a short description on the result page for that user. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.
+
+Place the quiz on the home page.
